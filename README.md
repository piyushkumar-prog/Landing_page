OIBSIP Level 1 - Task 1: Landing Page

This repository holds the source code for a landing page built using HTML and CSS.

# Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the fundamental structure and content of the landing page.
CSS: Enhances the landing page's visual appeal, layout, and responsiveness across various devices.

# Functionality:

Landing pages are designed with a specific goal in mind, typically to convert visitors into leads or customers. To achieve this goal, landing pages include several key functionalities:

#### Grabbing Attention:  
Landing pages need to quickly capture the visitor's interest and explain why they should care. This is usually done with a clear and concise value proposition displayed prominently at the top of the page.

#### Highlighting Benefits:  
Effective landing pages focus on the benefits of the product or service being offered, rather than just listing features. They connect the features to the problems the visitor is trying to solve and how the product or service will make their life better.

#### Lead Capture:  
A core function of landing pages is to collect contact information from visitors. This is typically done through a form that visitors fill out in exchange for a valuable offer, such as a free trial, ebook, or discount. The form should be clear, concise, and easy to use.

#### Call to Action (CTA):  
Landing pages should have a strong and clear call to action (CTA) that tells visitors exactly what you want them to do next. This could be signing up for a free trial, subscribing to a newsletter, or making a purchase. The CTA button should be prominent and visually appealing.
